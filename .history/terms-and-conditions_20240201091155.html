Providing information to Reason Test Prep Edu: Reason Test Prep Edu requires the applicant to provide Us information in order to receive our Services. This includes background information about their personal and professional experiences and essays, resume, etc. Our ability to provide Services is based on the quality and timeliness of Your information. While You are not required or obligated to disclose any information You are not comfortable sharing, it is Your responsibility to make sure that You provide accurate information at all times. Reason Test Prep Edu will never force You to share personal details that are sensitive or You are not comfortable sharing.</p><p>Some of our Services require You to send us Your application documents. For example, Our resume-review and essay-review Services require applicants to send Us their resume and school essay respectively. In these cases, it is up to You to make sure the documents You provide meet the guidelines specified by Us. These guidelines will be made clear to You through Our website, marketing collateral, and onboarding documents. As such, We will only be able to provide Our Services if You meet these specified guidelines. For example, our resume review Service requires that You upload a one-page resume in .doc or .docx format that is written in English. We will not be able to review and edit Your resume if it doesn’t meet these specifications. In this case, Reason Test Prep Edu’s fees are 100% non-refundable.</p><p>2. Upfront payment of fees: Reason Test Prep Edu agrees to provide You business school application Services only if 100% of the Fees for our Services are paid upfront. We reserve the right to decline Your rights to access Our Services if We don’t receive the entire payment amount stated on our Website. This includes willful or unwillful non-payment. Reason Test Prep Edu will not be able to provide You Services in situations such as Your credit card getting declined or if our third-party payment processor is not able to process the payment in your jurisdiction.</p><p>3. No guarantee of scholarships: Reason Test Prep Edu awards a small number of scholarships to Clients each year for Our Services. These scholarships are only meant to subsidize Our Services and cannot be used for anything else such as subsidizing Your business school tuition fees. Awarding these scholarships is completely at the discretion of Reason Test Prep Edu. We provide no guarantee that a certain number of these will be awarded each year. We take several factors into consideration while awarding scholarships such as financial need and professional potential. It is possible that during a certain year, no applicant fulfills Our criteria. In this case, no scholarship will be awarded. Also, we hold the right to not disclose to other Clients information about who has been awarded a scholarship.</p><p>4. No guarantee of delivery date: Reason Test Prep Edu provides timelines for when You can expect our Service to be delivered. These timelines are provided on Our website and through additional marketing collateral. You should note that these timelines should be viewed as guidelines and while We try Our best to provide Our Services in the timeframe listed on Our website, We do not guarantee that We will be able to do so. It might take longer for Us to deliver Our Services if our representatives including tutors are occupied with prior engagements.</p><p>5. Delivery of Services: We use a number of different internet-based third-party systems to provide Our Services. This includes, but is not limited to email, cloud-based text and voice communication systems, and cloud-based document sharing and project planning software. The medium of communication is different for every Service and might change as Reason Test Prep Edu’s Services evolve. We reserve the right to provide our Services through the medium that we think is the best fit. For example, Reason Test Prep Edu can decide to offer a Service purely through email-based communication rather than phone or video-based interactions.</p><p>6. No Guarantee of former Admissions Committee members: We engage former Admissions Committee members from business schools to work on certain aspects of Our Services. For example, Our All-Inclusive Service includes the review of a client’s final application by a former Admissions Committee member. We will clearly mention which services include a review by former Admissions Committee members on our website and through our marketing collateral. While we do our best to make this happen, We do not guarantee that the former Admissions Committee members will be able to review Your application documents. Former Admissions Committee members have limited time availability and they might have prior commitments when You decide to work with Us.</p><p>7. Selection of Tutor: When you work with Us, Reason Test Prep Edu tries to pair You with the most relevant Company representative, who in this case is an experienced Tutor. This could be a representative that you requested to work with, one whose background matches yours, or someone who has worked with You in the past. However, we don’t guarantee that we will be able to pair you with any particular representative. Our Tutors have varying workloads and internal company commitments such as working on Reason Test Prep Edu’s marketing initiatives. Hence, we can never guarantee that a Company representative will be available to work with you.</p><p>8. No guarantee of results: Getting your desired academic or test prep outcome depends on many factors, including factors outside a student or Reason Test Prep Edu’s control. As such, Reason Test Prep Edu cannot guarantee a positive result in any engagement. All testimonials, success stories (even if they are for similar applicants), or endorsements do not constitute a guarantee, warranty, or prediction regarding the outcome of your business school application. Past performance and prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Warranties of Services and Scope of Liabilities</strong></h3><p>FOUNDATION LEARNING’S SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO THE USER “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS”.

The only exemption to this condition is when U.S. federal law preempts California state law.</p><p><em>Arbitration Agreement</em></p><p>By agreeing to these Terms, Users agree that any dispute arising between them and Reason Test Prep Edu will be resolved informally or through a small claims court. Users and Reason Test Prep Edu will make all attempts in good faith to try and resolve issues without any escalation, controversy, or dispute. However, if a matter cannot be resolved through these means, it will be resolved through binding arbitration. The only exception to this will be when Reason Test Prep Edu or the User is seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in a court to resolve a dispute involving copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, logos, or intellectual property rights.</p><p><em>Notice of Arbitration and Opt-Out Clause</em></p><p>By agreeing to these Terms, You agree that You will not initiate or participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration against Reason Test Prep Edu. Any controversy, disagreement, or dispute that arises between You and any representative of Reason Test Prep Edu will be resolved through individual arbitration and shall be binding and final. By agreeing to these Terms, You explicitly agree that You do not have the right to trial by jury or the ability to act as a plaintiff or member of a class action lawsuit against Reason Test Prep Edu.</p><p><em>Rules of Arbitration</em></p><p>The arbitration will be governed by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). AAA will arbitrate in accordance with Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA rules”). For more information about these rules, please visit the AAA website (www.adr.com) or call AAA at 1-800-778-7879. A neutral arbitrator will arbitrate the matter, which will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p><p>Mechanics of Arbitration</p><p>The AAA’s rules will govern the mechanics of the arbitration process. A written notice must be provided to initiate it. The arbitration will solely focus on the matter being disputed and cannot be combined with anything else. It will be performed by a licensed practitioner who is a part of AAA’s list of approved arbitrators. The arbitrator will have the authority to arbitrate a part of or the entire dispute. Both parties involved in the dispute need to finalize who the arbitrator will be within seven days of delivery of the Demand of Arbitration (which needs to be submitted by the party initiating arbitration as per AAA guidelines). Failure to do so will result in AAA appointing an arbitrator. The decision made by the arbitrator will be final and binding. The arbitrator will provide a written explanation of the decision, which will include details of the arbitration award and might include attorneys’ fees, cost of witnesses, and travel costs, all of which together constitute the cost of arbitration.</p><p><em>Location of Arbitration</em></p><p>If the arbitration claim is $10,000 or less, the proceeding will take place solely based on documents provided by both parties. Unless the arbitrator decides otherwise, neither party will be required to appear for an in-person meeting or telephonic hearing. If an in-person hearing is requested by the arbitrator, he or she will decide on a place for the hearing that is convenient to all parties involved. If the claim is greater than $10,000 the arbitrator will decide the most convenient path forward, which could include electronic exchange of information, a telephonic hearing, or an in-person hearing. Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in San Francisco, California under California law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The decision around the most appropriate medium of information exchange shall always be governed by AAA rules and guidelines.</p><p><em>Arbitration Fees</em></p><p>The AAA rules define what Your portion of the AAA administrative fee and arbitration fee will be. The remaining amount will be paid by Reason Test Prep Edu. However, if the arbitrator finds Your claims to be frivolous (as measured in the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), AAA rules will determine the fees that You need to pay.</p><h3><strong>Type of Sale and Applicable Regulatory Frameworks</strong></h3><p>The contract between You and Reason Test Prep Edu is that of a sale of services and not goods. As such, regulatory frameworks such as The United Nations Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, Uniform Commercial Code or any legislation, which is materially similar to these does not apply to these Terms.</p><h3><strong>Contact Us</strong></h3><p>If You have any feedback on our Services or queries about these Terms, please email us at info@reasontestprepedu.com.
