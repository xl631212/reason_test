She has extensive experience in higher education, having served on the Academic Affairs Committee at Harvard University and worked at the Student Learning Center, coaching students in writing and research methods at UC Berkeley. Brittney also worked at the Transfer Center at UC Berkeley, which gave her an in-depth insight into what schools look for in transfer candidates.</p><p>Having coached dozens of candidates over the last few years, Brittney is a specialist in selective school admissions. Her greatest strengths as a coach are helping candidates identify their strengths and effectively communicate their story as a cohesive narrative across all aspects of their application.

Additionally, he has also worked as an admissions committee member for undergraduate and graduate school applications at UCLA. </p><p>Having worked as an educator and lecturer with many driven pupils, Chris genuinely enjoys having discussions with his students about their futures and learning about the place in the world they want to carve out for themselves as they mature. Chris is most excited to build a meaningful discourse with his Quad students about how to get into college while figuring out what they want in life and how best to achieve that moving forward. He deeply values his role as a coach and understands that learning from a mentor is a vital asset in the college application process. He aims to help his students tactically prepare for their college journey, giving them the space to craft a sense of who they are in a way that would help them succeed in the future.   </p><p>As a coach, Chris’s greatest strength is working with students holistically, helping his Quad students synthesize different elements of their life, skills, and experience to create a unified vision of who they are and what they can bring to a school. Chris possesses various academic and professional life experiences–pursuing multiple passions within seemingly disparate fields of interest. His breadth of experience makes him highly perceptive to his students’ needs, working with them to bring out a sense of what makes them unique, what matters to them, and how they can better shape their lives.</p><p>When Chris isn’t coaching, he is creative writing, building his YouTube channel, traveling, exercising, and learning more about history and current events. </p><p>Chris’s Pro Tip? </p><p>Admissions committees assess differences amongst an extraordinarily competitive applicant pool and have a clear picture of what sorts of applications genuinely stand out. As an applicant, it is essential to understand how to craft your story through effective writing styles, self-described life trajectories, letters of recommendation, and the overall personal tone of your application to stand out.</p></div></div></div><div id="w-node-_54a75658-3e95-c663-7010-0e454950df69-cfa6666c" data-w-id="54a75658-3e95-c663-7010-0e454950df69" class="popup-close-team"><img src="static/picture/64d0eb96e15af57fcfa6664e_Group182.svg" loading="lazy" alt="Close" class="close"></div></div><div data-w-id="54a75658-3e95-c663-7010-0e454950df6b" class="pop-up-bg"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="member-item w-dyn-item"><div class="member-wrap with-popup"><div class="tutor-top all auto-height"><div class="profile-wrap-2"><div class="profile-picture image"><img src="static/picture/64d0eb96e15af57fcfa669db_62f1ca14bd6c4c5dfc4e3c18_Christopher.jpeg" alt="Photo of team member described below" loading="lazy" class="image-12"></div></div><div fs-cmsfilter-field="Tutor Name" class="name-2">Christopher</div><div class="team-subjects">Subjects Tutored:</div><div class="team-subjects-list w-dyn-bind-empty"></div></div><div class="team-member-quote-wrap"><div class="team-member-quote w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div><div class="team-info-2">Admissions Counselor - University of Chicago</div></div><div class="popup-screen"><div class="team-popup"><div id="w-node-_54a75658-3e95-c663-7010-0e454950df60-cfa6666c" class="team-photo-avatar"><img src="static/picture/64d0eb96e15af57fcfa669db_62f1ca14bd6c4c5dfc4e3c18_Christopher.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-27"></div><div id="w-node-_54a75658-3e95-c663-7010-0e454950df62-cfa6666c" class="team-content-element"><div class="name"><div class="pop-name">Christopher</div></div><div class="popname-info center">Admissions Counselor - University of Chicago</div><div class="popname-info center w-dyn-bind-empty"></div><div class="div-block-63"><div class="rich-text-block w-richtext"><p>Christopher is a graduate of Northern Illinois University and The University of Chicago.

In addition, they have an MPH from the Harvard School of Public Health. Corey has served as an Interviewer at Georgetown University, where they interviewed and scored applicants. Professionally, Corey has served as an Attorney with over fifteen years of experience in public policy, including a decade of work in sexual and reproductive health and LGBTQ rights. </p><p>Corey’s interest in coaching stemmed from their own experience of applying to college as a first-generation student at a public school. They had to navigate the process solo and quickly became an expert among their friends. Corey’s guidance counselors even hung their application materials on the office walls as a template for other students! Since then, Corey has coached many students on their educational journey - whether as a teacher, an alum providing outreach, an employer mentoring interns, or a community volunteer working with youth programs.</p><p>As a coach, Corey thoroughly enjoys getting to know Quad applicants and learning about their goals. They pride themselves on being a good listener and motivating students to create what they hope to. Corey addresses any roadblocks honestly and works with students to find solutions together. Corey’s greatest strength as a coach is their approach to the application; they work with students to tackle it one step at a time while also planning ahead. This puts Quad applicants at ease, allowing them to enjoy applying to college with as little stress as possible. Corey is also a big fan of backward planning. They encourage applicants to start with what they are passionate about and what they can imagine spending their life doing - and working backward from there. At the end of the day, college admissions is very important, but it&#x27;s only the first step on the road to your future.</p><p>Writing and reading are two of Corey’s main passions.

What is your story? Why is this college perfect for you, and what can YOU offer to the college?

Some candidates had more experience while others had a better academic record, but the incoming class was always whole. </p><p>Demi&#x27;s passion for coaching stemmed from the help she received when applying to college herself. Based on her environment and situation, she did not have the resources to go to college. However, she had mentors who helped her at every step; they encouraged her to participate in pre-college programs she wasn&#x27;t sure she qualified for, and they encouraged her to sign up for competitions she never dreamed of. Most importantly, her mentors believed there was no limit to what she could do and were willing to get her where she needed to go. Demi understands the difficulties of applying to college, and her goal is to help applicants have options on where they go to college and beyond. </p><p>Demi&#x27;s greatest strengths as a coach include helping Quad applicants look through their experiences in a non-intrusive way to see the best version of themselves and articulate it in their application materials.

One of the most important things he learned through working in admissions is emphasizing depth over breadth. Many incorrectly assume that universities want a well-rounded student, whereas they&#x27;re actually seeking a well-rounded student body. Informed by this understanding, Donovan helps students demonstrate expertise and develop a focused, cohesive narrative across their applications, which are incredibly important to top-tier schools.</p><p>‍</p><p>Donovan also has an in-depth understanding of the importance of school-specificity in each application, as every school values different things. Having produced more U.S. presidents and Nobel Prize winners than any other university, Harvard, for example, tends to place greater weight on leadership qualities among applicants. Adjacent to Palo Alto and in the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford values an entrepreneurial spirit and calculated risk-taking more than many schools. Thus, it&#x27;s imperative that supplemental essays are tailored to a school and its characteristics, something that Donovan is passionate about helping students with.</p><p>‍</p><p>As a former varsity collegiate rower recruited to Harvard&#x27;s heavyweight crew team, Donovan has helped countless students excel in their sport and successfully navigate the athletic recruiting process. He likens his approach to that of a coach and thoroughly enjoys working with ambitious student-athletes. Having pursued cutting-edge STEM research and competitions throughout his career, Donovan likes building passion projects with students and is particularly interested in working with students who want to solve problems using STEM. At Quad, Donovan aims to be an approachable, accessible ally and is more than happy to work with students of all backgrounds.</p><p>‍</p><p>In his spare time, Donovan writes screenplays, teleplays, and sketch comedies. He enjoys reading nonfiction psychology books and loves board games like Catan and Monopoly. Apart from this, Donovan hangs out with his bearded dragon and is considering getting a giant breed dog soon.</p></div></div></div><div id="w-node-_54a75658-3e95-c663-7010-0e454950df69-cfa6666c" data-w-id="54a75658-3e95-c663-7010-0e454950df69" class="popup-close-team"><img src="static/picture/64d0eb96e15af57fcfa6664e_Group182.svg" loading="lazy" alt="Close" class="close"></div></div><div data-w-id="54a75658-3e95-c663-7010-0e454950df6b" class="pop-up-bg"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="member-item w-dyn-item"><div class="member-wrap with-popup"><div class="tutor-top all auto-height"><div class="profile-wrap-2"><div class="profile-picture image"><img src="static/picture/64d0eb96e15af57fcfa669ee_62b0da66ceb5f1d137febd04_Dorien.jpeg" alt="Photo of team member described below" loading="lazy" class="image-12"></div></div><div fs-cmsfilter-field="Tutor Name" class="name-2">Dorien</div><div class="team-subjects">Subjects Tutored:</div><div class="team-subjects-list w-dyn-bind-empty"></div></div><div class="team-member-quote-wrap"><div class="team-member-quote w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div><div class="team-info-2">Admissions Counselor - University of Pennsylvania</div></div><div class="popup-screen"><div class="team-popup"><div id="w-node-_54a75658-3e95-c663-7010-0e454950df60-cfa6666c" class="team-photo-avatar"><img src="static/picture/64d0eb96e15af57fcfa669ee_62b0da66ceb5f1d137febd04_Dorien.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-27"></div><div id="w-node-_54a75658-3e95-c663-7010-0e454950df62-cfa6666c" class="team-content-element"><div class="name"><div class="pop-name">Dorien</div></div><div class="popname-info center">Admissions Counselor - University of Pennsylvania</div><div class="popname-info center w-dyn-bind-empty"></div><div class="div-block-63"><div class="rich-text-block w-richtext"><p>Dorien is a graduate of Colgate University and the University of Pennsylvania.
